This is libOSC++, a kit for handling OSC in C++.  It was originally
written in the first half of 2002 by two Stetson University students:
Daniel Holth <dholth@fastmail.fm> and Clinton McChesney.  Since then
it has been used and enhanced by a class at Stetson and by some artists
in Germany.

We hope you will find it easy to use and understand, while being more
powerful than the original OSC kit.  This kit supports an introspectable
and self-documenting OSC namespace.  It lets the programmer be less
involved with the details of networking.

If you are using gcc to compile ProctoLogic, we recommend gcc-3 or better.
To enable this, set the environment variable CXX to the name of the newer c++
compiler, for example (in bash): export CXX=g++-3.0.4

Now, most linuxes will have gcc > 3 by default.

The most important subdirectories:
        src: libOSC++ source
        docs: some documentation.  UserManual.[doc|html] should be the most
	 helpful.

Two files (OSC-string-help.c and OSC-string-help.h) in this distribution
were taken from the original OSC kit and are used to provide some level
of backward compatibity.  Their copyright notice follows:
