Portability fixes. Since this libOSC++ uses IPv6 in actuality, it will
probably never run on MacOS 10.1; but it should compile on Jaguar.

Transmit object given clone() ability to facilitate #bundle handling.
*** The Transmit object created so callbacks can reply is now deleted
in UDPTransmit.cc - a few lines after it is created.  This means that
callbacks that wish to keep this reply object must clone it for later
use.  Example: Broadcaster
Broadcaster now clones its own personal Transmit object.
uniKit/Makefile.am simplified
