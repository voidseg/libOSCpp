- OSCServer does not set a port by default (if -p omitted)
> fixed, 19 apr. 2002, dwh
- 'Transmit' objects not properly deleted (should be at tail of call
  chain), else memory leaks
- Callbacks have zero documentation by default
- Some abstract superclasses may not have implementations of destructors,
  making it impossible to polymorphically destruct their specializations.
- 'skip' methods in unpacker unimplemented (mostly fixed but untested)
- byteswapping not implemented for hypers in packer, unpacker
- #bundle not implemented (make a special callback, careful with Transmit
  object)
- round-robin streams cause strange string corruption
- Broadcaster is a Transmit object but it cannot clone itself.
