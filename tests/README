Code to test this OSC implementation

glob and pattern.py should produce identical output.

Decided to get a good free implementation of globbing, instead of trying
to debug my buggy one. glob.cc and pattern.py don't work, oscmatch.cc
works quite well.

mikmodserver absolutely requires monaural uncompressed wav files. any
other kind of sample will cause it to crash on /play
